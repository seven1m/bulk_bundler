# Bulk Bundler

This is a standalone command that allows you to install dependencies for multiple Gemfile.lock files with one command.

Imagine you have many projects in your ~/projects directory. Rather than cd'ing into each project directory to run `bundle install`, you can run one command:

```sh
bulk_bundle proj1/Gemfile.lock proj2/Gemfile.lock ...
```

## Installation

```sh
gem install bulk_bundler
```
